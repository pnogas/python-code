#Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
#DEFINITION
#Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
#EXAMPLE
#input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
#output: C
